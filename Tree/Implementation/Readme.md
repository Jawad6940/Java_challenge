**This module** spans across many sections. First section of Introduction to Binary Trees introduces the basic concepts and definitions of Trees. Then BT Traversal and BT Construction Problems provide a sufficient practice of working with trees. A very important concept is then introduced in the section of Least Common Ancestor followed by some Miscellaneous Problems.

We then introduce two important variants of Binary Trees - Binary Search Trees (BSTs) and Heaps.
